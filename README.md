Welcome to our GitHub repository showcasing the development of a universal MRI imaging phantom, meticulously crafted to cater to a spectrum of research and clinical needs. This phantom presents a multilayered architecture nestled within a spherical shell, promising versatility and adaptability for MRI experimentation and calibration endeavours.

## Features

- Multilayered structure enclosed in a spherical shell
- Outer diameter of 170mm, optimised for compatibility with smaller head coils
- Three layers with multiple mounting holes for various modules and a coarse resolution grid on each
- Top and bottom layers affixed to the middle disc, snugly ensconced between the hemispheres, and reinforced with two silicone o-rings to prevent leakage
- Two tube fittings facilitate easy assembly and disassembly, with one designated for air release during refilling
- Utilising 0.5mL Eppendorf tubes to store any liquids of interest such as T1, T2, or proton density arrays
- The spherical shell is machined on a CNC lathe, while the discs are laser-cut from a 6mm acrylic sheet
- To achieve the desired precision, the resolution grids on the discs are added using a CNC mill, ensuring accuracy

## Additional modules

- Each disc features mounting holes for additional modules, facilitating further customisation and experimentation.
- Extra modules can be 3D printed using a consumer SLA printer
- Two modules are provided: a fine-resolution grid and a slice profile double-wedge
- A template for custom module design is provided
